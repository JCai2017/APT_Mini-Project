# APT_Mini-Project

Hi all, I've been testing all things together.
You can now clone the whole repo and upload to your own app engine to test.
It surely works now but still need to be tested, so try to create lot of streams and upload some images. Also try to use trending report and subcribe.

Be sure to modify the following files:
1.trending.py - Update5, UpdateHour, UpdateDay: change my email to your email
2.main,py - CreateStream - post: change my email to your email

Haven't meet Pep8 style yet.
